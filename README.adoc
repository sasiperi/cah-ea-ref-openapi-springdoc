= Introduction
This is a refernce implementation show casing best practices using spring doc for generating api specs for contract driven development (and testing). Salient aspects are documented here.

= Steps
<1> Get dependencies as detailed in the dependencies section.
<2> Add generic configuration (security policies, api info etc..) as called out code section (via spring configuration).
<3> Run the generate api gradle task `gradle clean generateOpenApiDocs` to generate documentation. And openapi.json should be available under the gradle build folder.
<4> Using the swaggor editor, inspect documentation "auto generated" by spring-doc.
<5> If you followed best practices and spring/java guidelines for builidng Rest Apis (important ones are called in the "Pre-requisites" section), already the document (opanApi Spec) generated should be good enough.
<6> Add springdoc openapi annotation into code, if the generated documentation is not enough? Which could be due to not following best practices OR due to legitamate excepions called out under " Handling the specific overrides"

= Pre-requisites (good rest-api pracices)

IMPORTANT: Springdoc is able to introspect the code, and is able to produce good documenation, with no additional coding. However. for the springdoc to auto-generate good documentation, before overriding with specific annotations, developers are required to follow, the following REST-API, Sping and Java coding practices.

. Good and meaning naming conventions of the variables, method names and models (pers Sun/Oracle guidelines)
. Exceptions and HTTP Responses (for global nature, applicable to all endpoints) handled via Rest Controller Advices
. All validations handled via JSR303 spec. For example
.. Plain POJOS (model/dto etc..) validated via javax.validator
.. JPA Entirties and such via hibernate validator

= Code details
== Dependencies
They are shown in the code snippet below. Details of which are below.

* *Required:*  
** sprindoc-ui depedency *alone* is enough to get core opanAPI spec generation and swagger-gui generation. 
** If GUI is *not* needed then one of mvc-core or webflux-core are required as depedencies.
** If the Rest API is built (system api to expose domains) using Spring-Data-Rest you also need to add springdoc-openapi-data-rest, so that springdoc will be able to introspect the JPA Repositories and auto generate documenation for you.
* *Opional (security):* Spring doc security plugin is needed, so as to ignore @AuthenticationPrincipal in case its used on REST Controllers and any possible errors that may occur (due to lack of oidc/sso during testing)
* *Plugins:*  The springdoc doc gradle/maven plugin is needed to generate json and yaml OpenAPI description during build time. The plugin works during integration-tests phase, and generate the OpenAPI description. The plugin works in conjunction with spring-boot-maven plugin.

== Global configuration
Create a spring configuration file and add global policies such as security configuration and information about API. Sample code is here.
https://github.com/cah-venkatasuryasasikala-peri/cah-ea-ref-openapi-springdoc/blob/3779a91d6aa1f62fab0e58548fe034e6e1ca7f87/src/main/java/com/example/demo/config/OpenAPIConfig.java#L22-L96

== JSR303 (javax/hibernate validator)
Sample code is here that shows how javax validation cane be used to generate validations into generated swaggerdoc (openAPI Spec)
https://github.com/cah-venkatasuryasasikala-peri/cah-ea-ref-openapi-springdoc/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/model/Book.java
`include::https://github.com/cah-venkatasuryasasikala-peri/cah-ea-ref-openapi-springdoc/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/model/Book.java`

== Rest Controller Advices
When checked/unchecked exceptons are handled properly, thrown properly up the stack (as needed to geneate HTTP Statuses), they can be handled via Rest Controller Advices across all endpoints. springdoc introspects into spring controller advices and is able to generate HTTP Status in the openAPI Spec. If an method/endpoint 
behaves differantly, throws specific HTTP Statuses (e.g a specifc endpoint is offered public, does not need throw securrity related HTTP Statuses) these can be overridden using specific spring doc annotations, as called out in the exceptions section.

https://github.com/cah-venkatasuryasasikala-peri/cah-ea-ref-openapi-springdoc/blob/c31c9a530080ea6716ebb1968c48571b0cf3e147/src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/exceptionhandler/MyControllerExceptionHandler.java#L17-L69


== Specific exceptions and annotations (ovderride generated opanapi, as needed)
spingdoc (mvc/webflux) core provides lot of annotations that can be used to produce very specific documentation (description, default values, http-statuses etc.. ). These exceptions can be handled (default doc can be overridden)

<1> Most of the specifc overrides can aslo easyly be handled via "application.properties". The comprehensive list of what can be handled via application configuration is here: https://springdoc.org/springdoc-properties.html
<2> Only if there is still anything that can not be handled via a) Global configuration b) And/Or via application onfiguration, need to be handled using these springdoc annotations if the "generic/global" configuration is not able to handle.

For example below code snippet has specific annoation for following reasons.

. Bad naming convention. 
.. For example in this sample code, it takes path param called ID, from this name we can not deduce it is intened to work more like boolean (1 or 0) so need to be explictly documented. 
.. Similarly the method name itself is named weird "purpleCow" it tells nothing about what it does? Not the endpoint path is created sensibly to deduce what it does. In this case more specific annotations are added to document openAPI/swagger well.
. Unlike all other methods this method/endpoint throws no errors, throws a special exception/http-status, thus instead of spindoc handle it via controller advice, we handled it via "specific annotation" @APIOperation etc...
. Similarly *if* it does not follow the global security policy (scheme) it can be overridden below via annoation **(which is usually a rare situation, usually all endpooits (respurce server) follows same "least privileged" security policy, and same oauth-grant type flows)**

            case 0 ->  book = new Book();
            default -> throw new InvalidTypeIdException(null, "No data was found mathcing the requested criteria == " + id, null, "Book");
        }         
        
        return book;
    }

== Where can I find final spec?
=== Static Spec
As we added gradle (or maven) spring doc plugin as a dependency, following `gradle task` (or `maven goal`) produce opanapi.json under *build* (or target) folder.
<1> *gradle*:  `gradle clean generateOpenApiDocs`
<2> *maven*:  `mvn verify -Dspring.application.admin.enabled=true`

== While running (dynamic content)
<1> *openapi spec*: Is available at "http://host:port/v3/open-apidocs **(e.g. when above repo is cloned and run locally they are vaialble @ http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)**
<2> *swagger gui*  Is available at "http://host:port/v3/swagger-ui.html **(e.g. when above repo is cloned and run locally they are vaialblehttp://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)**
